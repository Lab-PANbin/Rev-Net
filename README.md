ev-Net mainly includes two contributions: a flow-based endmember learning module, and a theoretical proof for the reversibility of the endmember generation process. In the endmember learning module, we develop a new flow-based structure with a series of reversible transformation, so as to obtain an explicit mathematical expression for the endmember distribution. Moreover, to guarantee the existence of the explicit expression, we have theoretically proven the reversibility of the endmember learning module. In addition, we also construct an abundance guidance module to further assist in the generation process of endmember by image reconstruction. Experimental results on real hyperspectral datasets and synthetic datasets indicate that Rev-Net has certain competitiveness.

If you use this code please cite the following paper "A Reversible Generative Network for Hyperspectral Unmixing with Spectral Variability".

syn3SV_data3cor30.mat is provided as an example dataset, and syn3SV_edm_3_30 is the endmembers obtained by the VCA.

You can run flow_edm3 to try our method.
